# bloxorz

Implementation of the Bloxorz game, done as a Functional programming course project.  

The game supports loading user-made levels from files, playing or editing them, as well as visualizing their solutions.  
Interacting with it can be done either from a CLI, or from a ScalaFX GUI.

## Installation

With `sbt` installed, run  

`sbt run`

from the root directory, and then pick the preffered interface.  

If using Linux, additional ScalaFX libraries may need to be installed beforehand.
